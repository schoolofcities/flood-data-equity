This map is part of the project lead by Dr. Nidhi Subramanyam to examine the availability of flood data that public can view/download from the internet. 

Data is stored on a google sheet to allow future data addition

The sheet is divided into three tabs, municipal, regional, and conservation authorities. Data from the open from the municipalilities will be stored in the municipal tab, regional government data (York, Peel, Halton.. etc) will be stored in regional table, and conservation authority data (i.e TRCA) will be stored in the conservation authorities tab.
